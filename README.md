**Project Title: Google Clone Project**

About the Project: This project is an extensive exercise in front-end development, inspired by the principles of responsive web design and user interface creation. By building a clone of the Google homepage, I aimed to reinforce my HTML and CSS skills while exploring key concepts like semantic markup, flexbox, and grid layout techniques. The project allowed me to experiment with styling and structuring a web page, ensuring that it functions well across different screen sizes and devices. Through this hands-on approach, I deepened my understanding of web development practices and gained confidence in applying these techniques effectively.

Key Learnings:

- Mastered HTML and CSS fundamentals for building responsive layouts.
- Improved proficiency in using flexbox and grid for efficient page design.
- Developed skills in semantic markup for improved accessibility and SEO.
- Enhanced problem-solving abilities through hands-on coding challenges.
